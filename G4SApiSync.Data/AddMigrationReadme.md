To add a migration in the G4SApiSync project, follow these steps:
1. Open Tools> NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console in Visual Studio.
2. Ensure that the Default Project dropdown is set to G4SApiSync.Data.

Run the following command to add a new migration:
   ```
   Add-Migration YourMigrationName
   ```
   Replace `YourMigrationName` with a descriptive name for your migration.

3. After running the command, a new migration file will be created in the Migrations folder of the G4SApiSync.Data project.
4. Review the generated migration code to ensure it accurately reflects the changes you intend to make to the database schema.
5. If necessary, modify the Up() and Down() methods in the migration file to customize the migration logic.
6. Once you are satisfied with the migration, you can apply it to the database by running:
   ```
   Update-Database
   ```
   This command will execute the migration and update the database schema accordingly.
